a collection of workflows and prebuilt code that will 

take common raw data collection types and clean/process the data into data that can be used by a 

script or something that will allow plug n play for any model from like a hugging face or any open source model I can run locally 

this will need a final local for our models -- we need to decide where we want trained models and if we want to program it to train locally and store onto gcloud or train on gcloud make these decisions when you get to this point

DONT DO UNTIL CTFII AND CTFI AND P4 are DONE!!!!
